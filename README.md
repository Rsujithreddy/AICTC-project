The traditional way of screening resumes takes a lot of time and is often influenced by human biases, making it less effective—especially when there are many applications to review. To solve this problem, this project introduces an AI-powered Resume Screening & Candidate Ranking System that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to automate and improve the hiring process. The system analyzes resumes, compares them to the job description, and ranks candidates based on how well they match, reducing manual work and making hiring decisions more accurate.
The system works by extracting important details from resumes and matching them with job requirements. Using advanced text-processing techniques, it converts unstructured text into numerical data and calculates similarity scores to measure how closely a candidate’s qualifications align with the job. This ensures a fair, efficient, and unbiased evaluation process.
By using AI, this system makes recruitment faster, reduces human involvement, and provides a structured way to shortlist candidates. It cuts down screening time while improving the accuracy of candidate selection. This project shows how NLP and ML can improve the hiring process by making it more data-driven, transparent, and scalable. The solution helps companies quickly find the best-fit candidates, leading to better hiring decisions and a stronger workforce.
