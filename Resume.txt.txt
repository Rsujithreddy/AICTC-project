Recruiters and hiring managers often struggle with efficiently screening and shortlisting resumes due to the high volume of applications received for job postings. Traditional resume screening is a manual, time-consuming, and subjective process, often leading to biases, inconsistencies, and missed potential candidates. As a result, qualified applicants may be overlooked, while unsuitable candidates might be considered, ultimately affecting the recruitment quality and efficiency.
This problem is significant because inefficient screening can lead to poor hiring decisions, increased recruitment costs, and longer hiring cycles. Companies risk losing top talent to competitors due to delayed responses, and HR teams spend excessive time reviewing resumes instead of focusing on strategic hiring initiatives. Additionally, manual screening lacks a standardized approach, making it difficult to ensure fairness and objectivity in candidate evaluation.
To address these challenges, there is a need for an AI-driven, automated resume screening system that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to objectively analyze and rank resumes based on job relevance. Such a system can streamline the hiring process, improve accuracy, and enhance the overall efficiency of recruitment, ensuring that organizations can identify the best-fit candidates quickly and fairly.
One of the key reasons for choosing this project is the increasing reliance on data-driven decision-making in modern HR practices. Companies are shifting towards automated and AI-assisted hiring to enhance efficiency and remove biases from the recruitment process. By using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, this project provides a structured and objective approach to resume screening, ensuring that candidates are evaluated purely based on their skills and qualifications rather than human perception.
